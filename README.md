üìù Overview

RFM segmentation is a popular customer analytics technique that classifies customers based on:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency (F): How often they purchase

Monetary (M): How much they spend

The goal is to group customers into actionable segments like Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, and Lost Customers, helping businesses make data-driven marketing and retention decisions.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

SQL: Used to clean, transform, and calculate RFM scores from the raw sales data.

Power BI: Used to create interactive dashboards for customer segmentation insights.

üß© SQL Workflow

The SQL script performs the following steps:

Data Preparation: Loads and queries sales_data.

CLV Calculation: Computes Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values per customer.

RFM Scoring: Assigns R, F, and M scores using NTILE(5) for quintile ranking.

Segmentation: Categorizes customers into groups like Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, etc.

Example snippet from the SQL file:

NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY RECENCY_VALUE DESC) AS R_Score,
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY FREQUENCY_VALUE ASC) AS F_Score,
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY MONETARY_VALUE ASC) AS M_Score

üìä Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI report provides:

üöÄ How to Run

SQL Setup:

Import your sales dataset into a database (MySQL used in this project).

Power BI Setup:

Open RFM Segmentation.pbix in Power BI Desktop.

Update the data source settings to point to your database (if using a different environment).

Refresh the data to load the latest segmentation results.
